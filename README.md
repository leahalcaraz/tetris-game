Features:
Pygame Implementation: Utilizes the Pygame library for graphics and event handling.
Random Piece Generation: Randomly selects Tetris pieces from predefined shapes.
Grid Management: Implements a grid system to track and clear completed lines.
User Controls: Allows users to move Tetris pieces left, right, and down using arrow keys.

How to Run:
Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
Run the script to start the Tetris game.
Use arrow keys to move the Tetris pieces and attempt to clear lines.

Acknowledgments:
The code structure and Tetris shapes are inspired by classic Tetris games.
